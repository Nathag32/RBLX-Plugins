Q: Are these backdoored?
A: No, there's literally no reason for me to do that. You can read through the entire source-code of each individual plugin if you don't believe me.

Q: How do you use these?
A: Simply grab a plugin from the "Plugins" folder and drag it into Roblox Studio. Now, right click it and publish it to Roblox. Install it, and you're done!
